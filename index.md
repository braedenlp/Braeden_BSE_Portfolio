# LED Matrix Scoreboard
If you have ever played a basketball game at an arcade, this project is a perfect desktop version. I built an interative basketball hoop that will count your score every time you make a basket, it will then display your score on the backboard. The way this works is that there are sensors in the hoop that detect when a ball goes in, it then relays that information to the circuit which then makes the score go up.

## What My Project is

My project is a mini hoop that has sensors in the hoop that will detect when a ball goes through the hoop which then makes the score on the scoreboard go up by two. It also has a button that starts a new game and resets the score. The progress I have made in this first milestone is that I got all of the hardware connected. I put together the entire hoop, soldered everything, and connected all the wires.

## Challenges

Challenges that I faced in this process is that I had to change multiple aspects of my project. I had to use a dremel to sand down the acrylic covering the matrix board because it was too big, the legs of the hoop were too small so I had to reprint those, and the wires kept snapping off of my circuit boards. I also had to change my milestones because the hardware aspect of this project took so long. On top of all that the matrix board that I originally had was broken so we have to get a new one but I initially thought that something was wrong with my circuit board. I ended up using a different, bigger, matrix board that was proven to work to hoop everything up.

## What's Next?

The next step I want to take in my project is to get all of my software working. This is getting my sensors working, the button, and the speaker all to work. None of this is working right now and it very frustrating so I hope to figure all of this out.

<!-- # Schematics 
Here's where you'll put images of your schematics. [Tinkercad](https://www.tinkercad.com/blog/official-guide-to-tinkercad-circuits) and [Fritzing](https://fritzing.org/learning/) are both great resoruces to create professional schematic diagrams, though BSE recommends Tinkercad becuase it can be done easily and for free in the browser. 

# Code
Here's where you'll put your code. The syntax below places it into a block of code. Follow the guide [here]([url](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)) to learn how to customize it to your project needs.

## Summary
I chose the calculator for my starter project because I wanted something that I will actually use and have an everyday use for. The way it works is that there is the integrated circuit, or IC, which performs all the calculations. The IC receives the input from the buttons when the buttons are pushed because the button closes a switch, which connects the circuit providing voltage to the IC. When the buttons are in their unpushed position, the switch is open so there is no current between the battery and the IC, but when the button is pushed, it closes the switch onto the circuit which connects a current with voltage to the IC. A switch is an electrical component that disrupts the current in a wire. The IC then displays the number then finished calculation on the seven segment display. The assembly process was pretty simple, the majority of the building process was soldering.

Figure 2: The figure above shows how switches function on an electrical circuit. The left shows an open switch and the right shows a closed switch, so the left would be an unpushed button and the right would be a pushed button. The difference between the two is that the left is an open circuit and the right is a closed circuit which means that the right can provide current to the light to light it up while the left can not.

## Challenges

Some challenges I faced were soldering and putting the case on. Soldering was somewhat challenging due to the fact that the majority of the project was soldering and some parts were small which made it harder to be precise while keeping the project clean. Another challenge I faced was the case. In the beginning of putting the case on, the battery didn’t fully fit into the slot and the charger didn’t fit into the slot for the charger.

## Next Steps

I am very excited to start on my main project and to see what I can learn from it.

<!--# Other Resources/Examples
One of the best parts about Github is that you can view how other people set up their own work. Here are some past BSE portfolios that are awesome examples. You can view how they set up their portfolio, and you can view their index.md files to understand how they implemented different portfolio components.
